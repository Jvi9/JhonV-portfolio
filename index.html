The platform is equipped with multiple water quality sensors‚Äîincluding pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), turbidity, and suspended solids (SST).

In one case, a floating station was installed inside a clarification dam, equipped with multiple sensors (pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, and suspended solids). Installation demanded a long-span cable system across the dam to mobilize the platform for maintenance and calibration.</p>
